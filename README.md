Welcome to my first pygame, and first coding project in general. (besides a bit of dabbling in html and css a few years back for a school project)

Just cats and dogs lol. Ran into a lot of errors since I used images instead of rectangles from the tutorial but pulled through with the help of my friends :D

Too lazy to cut the cat up properly so theres like an invisible 'box' surrounding it... :p
